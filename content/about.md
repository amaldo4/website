I am a junior full stack software developer focusing on the angular framework as well as ASP.NET. I worked in education before returning to school to persue a degree in computer science. I am a passionate worker and proven leader with excellent time/project/priority management skills. I am a capable learner who can not only rapidly close any knowledge gap, but I enjoy teaching others as well. I have been in the industry since summer 2022.

When not writing code at work, I enjoy working on cars, building computers, and playing/listening to music.
